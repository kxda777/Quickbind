# Quickbind
This lightweight FiveM script lets you bind a custom hotkey to any command for quick access. By default, pressing **F6** runs `/vs`, but both the key and command are easily configurable in the code. Ideal for menus, vehicle spawns, or admin tools, it saves time typing commands and keeps gameplay smooth and efficient.
